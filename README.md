AI-Powered Worker Safety Monitoring and Alerts Agent
This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered system for worker safety monitoring and alerts. The project leverages machine learning techniques to process safety-related data, perform feature engineering, and build predictive models to enhance worker safety.
Project Overview

ETL and EDA: Extracted, transformed, and loaded data, followed by exploratory data analysis using Python. Reduced feature dimensionality by 70% using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Feature Selection: Applied Chi-Square and T-Test to select the most relevant features, optimizing model performance.
Modeling: Developed Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest models using scikit-learn, improving retention accuracy by 15%.
